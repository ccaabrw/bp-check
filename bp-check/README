---------------------------------------

[ This is just a summary - see ~ccsposg/docs/general/bp_check ]
[ for more info.                                              ]

Quick guide:

Edit some bootptab's, run bp_check.auto it will give you a list
of new inconsistencies which show up.

Stuff that appears:

NAME  <hostname>	<not in DNS>	<MAC>	<server>
	Machine has no entry in DNS

HOST  <hostname>	<ipaddr>	<MAC>	<server>
	Multiple entries for the same hostname

MAC   <MAC>	<hostname>	<ipaddr>	<server>
	Multiple entries for the same hardware address

HELP  <gw-ipaddr> -> <serv-ipaddr>	<server>
	This gateway needs this helper address

MAC?  <MAC>	<hostname>
	Invalid MAC address (bad chars or length)

NET?  <hostname>	<ipaddr>	<gw> <sm> <server>
	Subnet mismatch between ip and gw addr's


Known stuff is listed in the bp_check.known file.
This file is updated using the bp_check.update script -
